Madeline Berger is a second year master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, specializing in conservation planning and environmental data science. She is particularly interested in the intersection between the globalized food system and conservation of wild land and sea habitats. Currently, she is working on a variety of projects including examining opportunties to recover usable organic material in coffee, chocolate, wine and olive supply chains, and opportunities to make fisheries less wasteful in the Galapagos. 

Having grown up attending a bilingual elementary school, Maddie learned to speak Spanish at a young age, which has allowed her to travel and collabrorate on projects in Latin America. She is particularly interested in environmental issues in the tropical regions and hopes to apply both her language and data analysis skills to conserving these critical ecosystems and improving livelihoods.
