<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project uses data on steelhead salmon fish passage at the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River to explore time series data cleaning and visualization. The data was compiled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and includes a value for daily number of fish that passed through the dam from 1940 to 2019. Also included is the data with a column for year and another column for month and day.</p>

<h3>Data Cleaning and Wrangling</h3>
<p>To better visualize this data in multiple ways, the dates first need to be parsed into date format and cleaned. They are read in as character data, which will not work logically when graphed.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>From these visualizations, we can see how steelhead numbers in the Columbia River have varied each year and each season. The daily passage time series plot indicates that daily steelhead counts have been somewhat consistent over time following a cyclical pattern. The exception is one day in 2009 that had very high counts.</p>
<p>The season plot helps illuminate what may be driving some of the cyclical trends in the time series plot. Every year, there is a clear increase in steelhead salmon passage starting from June to October, peaking dramatically in August. However, we can see there have been differences in the magnitude of this peak over the years. There appears to be an increasing trend from 1940 - 2019.</p>
<p>The annual passage plot confirms this observation, showing that total yearly counts of steelhead started increasing in 1980, but then have decreased since 2010.</p>
